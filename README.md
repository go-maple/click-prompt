## Check Node Version

We recommend that the minimum version of Node.js is 16.9.1 and above.

Check current the version of Node.js using the following command:

```shell
node -v 
```

## Manage Node Version with NVM

### Installing NVM

1. Open up your terminal.
2. Install NVM using the following command:
```shell
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.0/install.sh | bash
```

This command will download the install script for the latest version of NVM (as of the time of this writing) and run it with bash.

3. Follow the instructions provided in the terminal. The installer will prompt you to add a line to your `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc` file to ensure that NVM is properly sourced every time you open a new terminal window. You can also run the command manually if you don't want to modify your shell config file:

```shell
source ~/.nvm/nvm.sh
```

4. Once NVM is installed, you can use it to install and manage different versions of Node.js. To see a list of available versions, run the following command:

```shell
nvm ls-remote
```

5. To install a specific version of Node.js, run the following command:

```shell
nvm install <version>
```

Replace `<version>` with the version number you want to install. For example, to install Node.js version 16.9.1, run:

```shell
nvm install 16.9.1
```

6. You can check the currently active version of Node.js by running:

```shell
node -v
```

This will print out the version number of the currently active version of Node.js.

7. To switch to a different version of Node.js, simply run:

```shell
nvm use <version>
```

Replace `<version>` with the version number you want to switch to. For example, to switch to Node.js version 16.9.1, run:

```shell
nvm use 16.9.1
```

Congratulations, you have now installed and configured NVM on your system!, and try to run the ClickPrompt.
